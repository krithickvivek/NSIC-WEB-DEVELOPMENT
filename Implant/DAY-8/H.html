<h2>Deforestation, the widespread clearing of forests for agricultural, industrial, and urban development purposes, has profound consequences for global biodiversity. One of the most immediate impacts is the loss of habitat for countless species of plants and animals. Forests are not just clusters of trees; they are complex ecosystems that support a myriad of life forms, from tiny insects to large mammals. When these habitats are destroyed, many species lose their homes and struggle to survive. This disruption can lead to local extinctions and, in severe cases, contribute to the endangerment or extinction of species.</h2>
<h3>Moreover, deforestation disrupts the water cycle in forested areas. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing and retaining water through their roots and releasing it into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration. This process helps to regulate local and even regional climates, as well as maintain groundwater levels. With fewer trees, rainfall patterns can become erratic, leading to droughts in some areas and floods in others. These changes in water availability further stress local wildlife, especially species that rely on specific water sources for survival.</h3>
